## Overview

Event-Driven Order and Stock Management is a comprehensive microservices architecture project designed to revolutionize the way businesses manage orders and stock. This event-driven system is built on the principles of efficiency, real-time communication, and dynamic responses. By utilizing Kafka as the communication backbone, it enables businesses to process orders seamlessly, ensuring that stock availability is always up to date and orders are fulfilled without a hitch.

## Key Features

### 1. **Streamlined Order Placement**

Our system provides a user-friendly API through the Order Service, allowing users to place orders effortlessly. The moment an order is placed, a cascade of event-driven processes is set into motion.

### 2. **Real-Time Stock Availability**

The Stock Service plays a critical role in assessing stock availability in response to incoming orders. It promptly communicates the results back to the Order Service, ensuring that orders are fulfilled efficiently.

### 3. **Event-Driven Architecture**

Our project is entirely event-driven, enabling responsiveness and scalability. Kafka acts as the central nervous system for real-time communication among the various microservices.

### 4. **Dynamic Responses**

In a world where speed and accuracy are paramount, our system provides dynamic responses to order placements. It considers the real-time stock availability, ensuring an optimal user experience. Orders are either confirmed with success or flagged for further action based on stock availability.

### 5. **Data Storage and Management**

The project leverages a PostgreSQL database for robust data storage and management. It ensures that critical information about orders and stock is secure and accessible.
